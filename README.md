## What's Cozy?

![Cozy Logo](https://cdn.rawgit.com/cozy/cozy-guidelines/master/templates/cozy_logo_small.svg)

[Cozy][cozy] is a platform that brings all your web services in the same private space. With it, your webapps and your devices can share data easily, providing you with a new experience. You can install Cozy on your own hardware where no one's tracking you.

## What's cozy-client-js?

`cozy-client-js` is a javascript library made by Cozy. It enables applications (client-side apps, konnectors, OAuth apps, etc.) to make requests to the cozy stack.

If you are getting started on cozy application development, you should follow this [tutorial](https://docs.cozy.io/en/dev/app/). [The reference documentation](https://docs.cozy.io/en/cozy-client-js/README/) is the place to see what you can do with this lib, and how to do it!
